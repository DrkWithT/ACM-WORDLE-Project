# ACM-WORDLE-Project

## Brief
This repository contains files for the ACM Beginners' Workshop Project: A Wordle Game. It will be written using Java SE 18 and the classic Swing GUI framework, and it will implement part of the features on this [implementation](https://wordlegame.org/).

## Tentative Feature List
 1. Basic wordle functionality: 6 tries to guess a word, highlight incorrect, included, or correct letters as gray, yellow, or green.
 2. Maybe a menu that does the following:
    - Change word length from 4 to 8.
    - Show or clear stats.

## Tools
 1. Manual compilation with `javac`.
    - Build (Derek T.): `zsh build.sh`

## Notes:
 1. Derek T.'s files: `.vscode`.
